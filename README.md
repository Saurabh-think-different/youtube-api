# Youtube-api
Python scripts working on youtube api.  
Youtube api works with `google-api-python-client`.


## yt_playlist_duration

It is self explanatory. Need to fill in the playlist name and the script calculates total viewing time for your playlist.   
Outputs in HH:MM:SS format,

## youtube_popular_videos

I loved working on this one. Here you need to fill in the playlist name and the script sorts all videos in the list in descending order of vid_views.   
It outputs in a neat Tabular fashion which has the name of the videos, Link to the videos, and NO_OF_VIEWS.

 From here on I look forward to integrate this with my website which has clickable link and responsive intefaces that everyone can access instead of a CLI.
